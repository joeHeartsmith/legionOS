- integrate stopExec package into baseline
- this will require yet another support repository (i.e. for profiles, and with systems of matching kernel versions)
    - because the kernel versions have to match, maybe the package manager needs to dynamically spin-up cloud VPSs to (quickly) compile against the desired kernel version quickly
        - IF THIS IS THE SOLUTION, we would need to add a 'requests' mechanism to the package manager (i.e. 'i want this package' -> 'ok, I'm making it.  I'll send it to you async when it's ready, and we can resume however you like (i.e. manually, automatically, immediately, post-delay, post-reboot, post-other-package-dependency-getting-installed, etc.))
        - if we can get stopExec to work with DKMS, we probably don't need this
- profile update issues could be helped with [60 - fs-boot-watchdog](https://github.com/joeHeartsmith/legionOS/blob/main/60%20-%20fs-boot-watchdog.md)
