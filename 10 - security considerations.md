- a lot of this is going to be a huge pain, so will end up in post-beta releases

- selinux policies
- auditing policies
	- ld.so.preload (and other important files that don't exist by default)
- tripwire (and policies)
- grsecurity/PAX (subscription?)
- AIDE (trusted path execution)
- secureboot
- default compilation hardening:
	- stack-smashing protection
	- stack-clashing protection
	- RELRO + BIND_NOW
	- FORTIFY_SOURCE
	- FCF-protection (control flow)
	- PIE-by-default
		- and ASLR
		- and W^X
- default sysctls (see https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/guides/linux-hardening.html)
- some sort of utility to easily enable ld.so *secure-execution mode*
	- stops LD_PRELOAD attacks for things like privesc
	- could possibly be a patch for OpenRC/systemd
	- 2 methods to do it: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/241063/how-to-globally-enable-ld-so-secure-execution-mode-for-all-applications
- kernel hardening
- standard ports hardening
	- steal gentoo's USE-flags system
- add ip6tables 'foward-only' policy to firewall scripts system (commented-out?)
- setup for container support (i.e. dealing w/SELinux)
- prefer bleeding-edge packages
	- in today's world, running unstable software has probably become safer, becuase you're now only vulnerable to zero-days
	- trade-off between stability and security (should the website be down because it crashed, or because it was hacked? regardless, users can tune this preference to their liking (either manually per-package, or by selecting one of the distro-update flavors)
		- some stability should hopefully be restored through services like package-service-watchdog and the fs-boot-watchdog
