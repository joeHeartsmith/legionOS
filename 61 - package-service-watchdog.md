- like fs-boot-watchdog, but for individual services
- when booting up, check for service failures
	- offer config file to add ignored services (i.e. networking)
- depending on configuration, if a service was restarted, but failed (especially when invoked by the package manager), roll the service back automatically
- this should work with the package manager.  for example, if we download a new package and it doesn't work, we need to report that to the package manager, so it can tell the main repo that there's a problem.
	- this enables the package manager to not push bad/incompatible packages from BLEEDING to LATEST-TESTED until they are fixed (either via a new update, or via the PATCHES system)
